# titlebar-colour

Ensure each VSCode window has a titlebar with a different colour.

## Bundle

See [Publishing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) for more information about building and publishing bundles.

To generate a bundle (`.vsix` file) that you can install into VSCode locally, run the following command:

```bash
npx vsce package
```

This will build a file with a name like `titlebar-colour-0.0.2.vsix`.

## Install Bundle

"
For users, to install a .vsix file in VS Code:

1. Go to the Extensions view.
2. Click Views and More Actions...
3. Select Install from VSIX...
"

On VSCode on macOS, you have to click on the breadcrumbs (...) in the top-right of the Extensions pane, in order to see the "Install from VSIX..." option.
